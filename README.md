# noodlebox/userscripts
Assorted userscripts, too small to warrant their own repos. These scripts are also hosted at and set to update from [here](https://files.noodlebox.moe/userscripts/). You will most likely need a userscript manager, such as [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/), which should be available for whichever browser you use. For userstyles, I recommend [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/).

## Scripts

### CGCookieGalleryFix.user.js  (cgcookie.com)
Fix bug in gallery when too few items exist to allow scrolling. Bug was reported, but hasn't been fixed after quite a while.

### DiscordAutoGif.user.js (discordapp.com)
Automatically play GIF and GIFV embeds without hovering. Note that animated content can eat a bit of CPU time (which is why auto-play is disabled in the first place).

### DiscordLineNumbers.user.js (discordapp.com)
Add line numbers to code blocks. It's recommended to add DiscordLineNumbers.css as a userstyle, if not using another theme that includes style rules for this.

### DiscordOwnerTag.user.js (discordapp.com)
Show a tag next to a Discord server owner's name. Simple feature addition, since there's nothing else in the UI to identify a server owner.

### KawaiiLab.user.js (sfmlab.com)
Make SFMLab more kawaii. Pointless tweak to the site logo, commemorating previous KawaiiLab and MikeLab hacks.

### QuoraNoLogin.user.js (quora.com)
Bypass modal login prompt. If it shows up in search results, the content shouldn't be hidden behind a login.
